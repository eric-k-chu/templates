# templates

Templates that can be pulled with [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit)

All templates here are in TypeScript.

Templates are managed by branches in order to fully integrate with degit. Not exactly the intended use of branches, but it actually works quite well.

#### Usage

```bash
pnpm dlx degit eric-k-chu/templates#react-ts
```
